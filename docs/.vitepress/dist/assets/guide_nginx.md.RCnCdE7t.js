Nginx acts as a reverse proxy server, ensuring secure, efficient, and scalable communication between the different components of the application.</p><h2 id="overview" tabindex="-1">Overview <a class="header-anchor" href="#overview" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Overview&quot;">​</a></h2><p>In the current project, there are two backend services:</p><ul><li><strong>Laravel</strong>: Handles API requests and core functionality, such as user management and dictionary word management.</li><li><strong>Node.js</strong>: Manages real-time communication through WebSockets and supports features that require a persistent connection (e.g., messaging).</li></ul><p>To enhance security, performance, and scalability, Nginx is used as a reverse proxy. This setup allows:</p><ul><li>Efficient management of traffic between frontend and backend services.</li><li>SSL encryption for secure communication.</li><li>Load balancing and routing of requests to the appropriate backend service.</li></ul><h2 id="purpose-of-nginx-reverse-proxy" tabindex="-1">Purpose of Nginx Reverse Proxy <a class="header-anchor" href="#purpose-of-nginx-reverse-proxy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Purpose of Nginx Reverse Proxy&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Nginx serves as the intermediary between the user’s browser (or client-side application) and the backend servers. It allows for:</p><ul><li><strong>Request Routing</strong>: Nginx routes incoming HTTP(S) requests to the correct backend service based on the URL path.</li><li><strong>SSL Termination</strong>: SSL encryption is handled by Nginx, ensuring secure communication between the client and the server.</li><li><strong>Load Balancing</strong>: Requests can be distributed across multiple backend instances if needed, improving scalability.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: By hiding the direct access to backend servers, Nginx reduces potential attack vectors and enhances security.</li></ul><h2 id="flow-of-requests" tabindex="-1">Flow of Requests <a class="header-anchor" href="#flow-of-requests" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flow of Requests&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><strong>Frontend (Vue.js/Node.js)</strong>: The frontend, built with Vue.js and Vite, is served by Nginx. Requests from the user interface for static assets or real-time data are routed through Nginx.</li><li><strong>API Requests (Laravel)</strong>: When the user interacts with the application (e.g., looking up dictionary words or managing user profiles), Nginx forwards these API requests to the Laravel backend.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Data (Node.js)</strong>: For real-time features like chat or notifications, requests are forwarded to the Node.js server, which utilizes WebSockets for persistent communication.</li></ol><h2 id="why-nginx-is-used" tabindex="-1">Why Nginx is Used <a class="header-anchor" href="#why-nginx-is-used" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Why Nginx is Used&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Performance</strong>: Nginx is highly efficient at handling concurrent connections and can handle large amounts of traffic with low resource consumption.</li><li><strong>Security</strong>: Nginx helps secure the backend services by acting as a proxy, preventing direct access to the internal servers.</li><li><strong>SSL Encryption</strong>: Nginx handles SSL termination, ensuring that communication between the client and the server is encrypted without burdening the backend services.</li><li><strong>Ease of Management</strong>: Nginx simplifies the management of multiple backend services, allowing each service to focus on its specific functionality without handling traffic routing or encryption directly.</li></ul><h2 id="key-features-of-nginx-in-this-setup" tabindex="-1">Key Features of Nginx in This Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#key-features-of-nginx-in-this-setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Key Features of Nginx in This Setup&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><strong>Reverse Proxy</strong>: Directs incoming requests to the appropriate backend service (either Laravel or Node.js).</li><li><strong>SSL Encryption</strong>: Secures data in transit, ensuring that user data is protected.</li><li><strong>Real-Time Communication</strong>: Supports WebSockets and other real-time features in the Node.js backend.</li><li><strong>Static Content Delivery</strong>: Serves static files (CSS, JS, images) from the frontend directly, improving load times.</li></ul><h2 id="conclusion" tabindex="-1">Conclusion <a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Conclusion&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Nginx serves a critical role in the architecture of the project by acting as a reverse proxy to manage communication between the frontend and backend services. By using Nginx, we ensure the application is secure, scalable, and performs efficiently under heavy traffic. This setup also allows for flexible scaling and easy maintenance of the frontend and backend services.</p>',18)]))}const f=n(a,[["render",s]]);export{h as __pageData,f as default};
