# CI/CD Documentation

This document explains the Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline used in the project, detailing the process for automating code testing, building, and deployment.

## Overview

CI/CD is an essential part of modern software development, ensuring that code changes are tested, built, and deployed automatically. The CI/CD pipeline for this project integrates various tools and services to automate and streamline the process.

## CI/CD Process

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**:
    - Developers push code changes to a shared repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
    - Every push triggers an automatic build process that tests the code for errors and integrates it into the main codebase.
    - Automated tests are run to check for issues before code is merged into the main branch.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**:
    - Once the code passes all tests and is merged, the CD pipeline automatically deploys it to staging or production environments.
    - Deployments are usually performed in containers, ensuring that the environment is consistent across different stages.
    - The pipeline includes steps like creating Docker images, pushing them to a container registry, and deploying the containers using tools like Kubernetes or Docker Compose.

3. **Monitoring and Alerts**:
    - After deployment, the pipeline monitors the application to ensure that it is running smoothly.
    - If an issue occurs, automated alerts are sent to the development team, notifying them of any failures in the deployment process or the application's behavior.

## Example Pipeline

The following is an example of a simple pipeline configuration using **GitHub Actions**.

**GitHub Actions Pipeline**:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14'

    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install

    - name: Run tests
      run: npm test

  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    - name: Deploy to production
      run: |
        docker build -t my-app .
        docker push my-app
        kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```
