# User Management in Laravel

User management in this Laravel application includes handling user-related functionalities such as managing words assigned to each user, managing their teams, and associating specific categories with them.

## Managing User-Specific Words
Each user has their own set of words that belong exclusively to them. These words are stored in a dedicated database table.

### Implementation:
- Define a `UserWord` model and migration:
   ```php
   php artisan make:model UserWord -m
   ```
- Create a relation in the `User` model:
   ```php
   public function words()
   {
       return $this->hasMany(UserWord::class);
   }
   ```

## Team Management
Each user belongs to multiple teams and owns at least one team (their own team).

### Implementation:
- Define a `Team` model and migration:
   ```php
   php artisan make:model Team -m
   ```
- Set up relationships in the `User` model:
   ```php
   public function teams()
   {
       return $this->belongsToMany(Team::class);
   }

   public function ownedTeam()
   {
       return $this->hasOne(Team::class, 'owner_id');
   }
   ```

## Managing User-Specific Categories
Each user has categories that are specific to them, allowing for better organization.

### Implementation:
- Define a `Category` model and migration:
   ```php
   php artisan make:model Category -m
   ```
- Create a relationship in the `User` model:
   ```php
   public function categories()
   {
       return $this->hasMany(Category::class);
   }
   ```

## Conclusion
By implementing these features, the user management system in Laravel becomes robust, allowing users to manage their words, teams, and categories efficiently.
