# Performance Optimization

Optimizing performance ensures that the Modern Dictionary can scale efficiently even under heavy traffic. Here are the strategies used to optimize performance:

```php
$word = Cache::remember('word:' . $wordId, 60, function () use ($wordId) {
    return Word::find($wordId);
});
```
